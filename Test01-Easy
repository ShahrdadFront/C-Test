Write a C# program that reads a text file and outputs the frequency of each word in the file. Your program should:

Read the file path from the user.
Read the content of the file.
Count the frequency of each word, ignoring case and punctuation.
Output the top 10 most frequent words and their counts.
Constraints:

You must handle file read errors gracefully.
Ignore words shorter than 3 characters.
Consider using Dictionary<string, int> for storing word frequencies.
Example Input:

File content: "Hello world! Hello C# developers. C# is awesome."

Problem: Implement a Mini Database Engine

Design and implement a simplified in-memory database engine in C#. Your program should:

Support basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
Allow defining a schema for a table.
Support simple queries with filtering capabilities.
Handle concurrent access using locking mechanisms.
Requirements:

Define a Table class to store records.
Define a Record class to represent individual records.
Use appropriate data structures to optimize read/write performance.
Implement basic query support with filtering (e.g., SELECT * FROM Table WHERE Field = Value).
